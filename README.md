# Memed.Fun

Where memes meet money, and creators become legends. Memed.Fun is a platform that lets creators mint their own meme tokens, battle for supremacy, and reward their community through the power of Lens Protocol.

## üåü What's the Hype?

Imagine if your favorite meme creator could:
- Mint their own token

### 3. Staking & Rewards
